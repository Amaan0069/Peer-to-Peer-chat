# Peer-to-Peer Real-Time Chat Application

The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Chat Application is a decentralized messaging platform designed to facilitate direct communication between users without the need for a central server. By eliminating reliance on intermediary servers, the application ensures enhanced privacy, security, and user control. Messages are transmitted directly between users via TCP sockets, enabling real-time communication while maintaining data integrity.

Users can register on the platform using their email address or mobile number, search for other users, and establish direct connections for seamless communication. To ensure message reliability, the application incorporates a temporary message storage mechanism. If a recipient is offline, messages are securely stored and delivered automatically once the user reconnects, guaranteeing no loss of communication.

Additionally, the application features an online status indicator, which displays a green badge next to a userâ€™s name when they are active and available for communication. This functionality enhances user experience by providing real-time visibility into the availability of contacts.

The P2P Chat Application integrates advanced socket programming, networking principles, and intuitive user interface design to deliver a robust and efficient messaging solution. It is an ideal platform for users seeking a secure, private, and decentralized communication tool.
